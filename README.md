Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to highly recommend my former colleague, Alexandra Ashie. I had the pleasure of
working with her at Trust & Will and was consistently impressed by her abilities and dedication
to her work.

One of Alexandra’s greatest strengths is her ability to learn quickly. Whether it was a new
software tool or a new method for testing, she was always eager to dive in and master new
technology. This adaptability was particularly valuable during our fast-paced and constantly
evolving work environment. Alexandra’s initiative and drive to continuously improve are a
testament to her strong work ethic and passion for her field.

In addition to her technical aptitude, Alexandra is a skilled communicator and an exceptional
team player. She has the unique ability to build strong relationships with her colleagues, which
greatly enhanced collaboration and productivity on our team. Her positive attitude and helpful
demeanor made her an esteemed member of our team.

Alexandra also has a keen attention to detail and a commitment to delivering high-quality work.
She is meticulous in her testing procedures and is always looking for ways to improve and
optimize her work. This attention to detail, combined with her technical prowess, made her an
invaluable member of our team and a trusted colleague.

In conclusion, I highly recommend Alexandra and I am confident that her combination of
technical aptitude, strong interpersonal skills, attention to detail, and drive to continuously
improve will make her a valuable asset to your organization.

Sincerely,
